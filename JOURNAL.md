# Day 1 - I created the different Markdown Files and The Jupyter Notebook 

    After creating the jupyter notebook, I decided to think about the file structure and what all would be needed and created it to match accordingly.

# Day 2 - I started to build out the Jupyter Notebook to contain the information I knew for sure I would need. 

    On Day 2 I decided to compile most of the code with the help of Gpt 4o-Mini and got far enough that I was able to use the api to retreive the NFL Teams. I am calling it here and will work on correctly fetching athelete or team stats to then get the prop generation working. 

# Day 3 - I sat on my laptop so I created a GitHub Codespace to continue working on the project basically anywhere.

    My objectives for Day 3 are as follows: Familiarize self with codespaces, adapt code to work in codespaces up until last point, fix API data pull of player stats and etc.
